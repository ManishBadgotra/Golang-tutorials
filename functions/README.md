In Go, functions are the basic building blocks. A function is used to break a large problem into smaller tasks. We can invoke a function several times, hence functions promote code reusability. There are 3 types of functions in Go:
    -Normal functions with an identifier
    -Anonymous or lambda functions
    -Method (A function with a receiver)

Function parameters, return values, together with types, is called Function Signature.

NOTE: Function cannot be declared inside another function. If we want to achieve this, we can do this by anonymous function.

For Function's syntax and how they work look for the specific file in Function folder.
