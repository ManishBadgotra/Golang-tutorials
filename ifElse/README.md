This is an if-else practice section.
    There are many functions that I made to practice if-else questions like,
        Age Checker
        Leap year checker
        Login Checker
        Odd-Even
        Positive-Negative Checker


Different files that exist in ifElse folder:

    Package Requirements according to individual files:
        -bufio
        -fmt
        -os
        -strconv
        -strings

    files:
        -ageChecker.go 
        -leapYearChecker.go
        -loginChecker.go
        -oddEven.go
        -plusMinusChecker.go
        -reader.go
        -error.go

    Working of files individually:
        All input that are entered by user will be converted into number individually in every file where necessary.
        -reader.go:
            Gives two output 1st user's input and 2nd error (if any).
        -error.go:
            Takes error (if any) and Prints that error to the user.
        -plusMinusChecker.go:
            Input will get checked if value is Positive, Negative or Zero and prints the respective output.
        -oddEven.go:
            Checks for Odd or Even for a number given by user.
        -loginChecker.go:
            Takes email and password from user and compare it with fixed email and password if both matches then shows "Login successfull" and if do not matches then shows "Login unsuccessfull".
        -leapYearChecker.go:
            Validates if the given number is leap year or not according to Gregorian calender.
